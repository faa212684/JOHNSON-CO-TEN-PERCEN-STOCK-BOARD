I see trees of green........ red roses too 
I see em bloom..... for me and for you 
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world. 

I see skies of blue..... clouds of white 
Bright blessed days....dark sacred nights 
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world. 

The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky 
Are also on the faces.....of people ..going by 
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin.. how do you do 
They're really sayin......i love you. 

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow 
They'll learn much more.....than I'll never know 
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world

The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky 
Are there on the faces.....of people ..going by 
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin.. how do you do 
They're really sayin...*spoken*(I ....love....you). 

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow 
*spoken*(you know their gonna learn 
A whole lot more than I'll never know) 
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world 
Yes I think to myself .......what a wonderful world.
