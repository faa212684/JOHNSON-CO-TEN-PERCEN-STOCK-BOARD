1) Consider database of 100K songs with lyrics
2) Use dictionary of word to emotion category mapping where each word's presence in 
each of eight categories is given.
3) Write script which takes in song's lyrics as input from stdin and then gives a csv as output with columns as each mood category
and value as count of word in each category, also save total number of words in song.
